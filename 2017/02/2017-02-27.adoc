=== 2017 February 27

I've been thinking about what to write here yesterday and today as well.
I've came to the conclusion that right now *what I write here and how much* I'm writing *is secondary to other things* like

* learning about electronic circuits,
* or meditating and relaxing,
* or playing the guitar,
* or reading,
* running,
* "`Sarah time`"
* etc.

What I'm doing is I'm trying to set aside a small amount of time for _everything_ I'm interested in and I try to regularly do them or fiddle with them.
*Regularly* and *small amount* of time are the keywords.

My *stuttering* (or the lack of it) *is still important*, but I got to know it to such a degree that I can handle it.
At least far easier than I was able to earlier.

I'm *still frustrated sometimes* when I feel that my stutter is holding me back, but *even in those moments I'm able to overcome my fears and anxieties*.

When I think about stuttering *I relate to it _completely_ differently* now.
