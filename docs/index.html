<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve decided this minute that it would be a good idea to write some sort of diary or log about my thoughts on stammering and on my progress on dealing with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today I had to talk a lot.
With my fellow mentors and with my students also.
Several times I wasn’t able to say what I wanted.
I got stuck on the word &#8220;parameter&#8221; (in Hungarian the first letter is emphasized more clearly so it’s even harder to pronounce).
This is just on &#8220;those&#8221; words I had trouble with today.
I’ve tried to relax, stop, before retrying the word only or retrying the word before or even a complete phrase.
Most of the time I wasn’t able to fully relax &#8230;&#8203; or let me rephrase, I didn’t feel &#8220;effortlessness&#8221;, when I retried I was still making too much effort it seems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also hesitated a lot, before addressing one of the students, because his name is Krisztián (Christian basically).
I was trying to get calm, before saying it &#8230;&#8203; but it didn’t really work.
Eventually I just waited for a moment where I could address him without saying his name, because I &#8220;wanted to get my message across&#8221;&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it was important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the end of the day I had a one-on-one session with one of my students.
Several times I stuttered, blocked, restarted the word, but most of the time it didn’t work.
However, for a fraction of a moment, if I remember correctly and I hope I do!, I was able to sense, to bring myself into &#8220;effortless&#8221; mode when I tried to say a word the second time.
I was able to say the word slowly.
One or two times maybe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Okay.
Enough of the negativity!
This was a crappy day, but I didn’t dodge hard words and replaced them all day long, which is a good thing.
I was able to arrange most of the things I wanted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tomorrow I want to focus on talking a bit <em>slooowly</em> when I restart a word.
I want to bring awareness to this! Positivity!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_2016_november_29">2016 November 29</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This day is over too.
Today we talked about with the other Miskolc mentors that we’ve been feeling a bit down since the last few days.
Few students left, some of who stayed aren’t exactly at the top of their games.
The whole day was a bit gloomy and overshadowed by this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the day I didn’t manage to bring awareness to my talking, the way I talk.
In a few instances I was able to keep calm.
I think I was forcing myself to &#8220;be fluent&#8221;.
Or, this is what I ended up doing.
What I wanted to do was to be able to repeat a &#8220;blocked word&#8221; better.
A few times it worked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of work I had a talk with my superiors/management.
I think that talk went well.
I stuttered a few times.
I stopped and backtracked and said what I wanted in a calmer fashion.
There’s still room for improvement!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just before I’m writing this I talked with my girlfriend over the phone.
To say goodbye I wanted to say something to her, a word, which I’m always saying to her when we hang up.
The word is &#8220;puszikállak&#8221;, which means something like &#8220;lots of kisses&#8221; in a cute way.
Anyway.
I wanted to say the word.
Just the word.
No frills before it.
I tried like &#8230;&#8203; whole bunch of times, but it took a while to say it.
5 minutes maybe?
I would have been able to say if I said something before it I think.
I’ve tried &#8220;forming&#8221; the word without trying to voice it.
Didn’t work.
I took deep breaths.
Tried &#8220;hmming&#8221; before the word.
To no avail.
Then I’ve managed to stutter the word and then I was able to say it without a problem .
I got a bit flustered.
But I think I still managed to keep being &#8220;aware&#8221; of the situation.
What did I notice? Even when I thought I was calm and relaxed I had a higher heart rate than normal I think.
The other thing is that I guess if I keep thinking about &#8220;you have to be calm&#8221; I never be calm.
Interesting that’s for sure, but the true emotion I feel is frustration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tomorrow, I want to be aware of my speech’s speed.
I want to talk slower.
I think I forgot today this.
Simply, I want to talk slower.
Not always.
I want to control the speed of my speech.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I just finished my Skype session with Sarah.
How do I feel afterwards.
Still motivated, but I feel sometimes that as I learn more about my &#8220;situation&#8221; and thoughts it gets a bit complicated &#8230;&#8203; eh, scratch that thought!
Whatever happened so far and will happen from now on I feel I’m going forward and I’m getting to know myself better and better which is cool!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, I’d like to kindly remind myself here that even if I block on a word there are several ways to experiment with to get that word into the conversation somehow.
Also, I want to remember how it feels to be in &#8220;session mode&#8221;, where I’m open to experimentation, so that next time when I find myself in a speaking situation I could remember &#8220;alternative&#8221; ways to approach to say words, or to feel after a block or before a block.
Including trying how it feels to allow myself to talk slower.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just another thought before closing this diary entry: <strong>I remembered</strong> just now why I wanted to work in Codecool in the first place&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<strong>my original goal</strong>.
It was something like <strong>&#8220;to get better at communication&#8221;</strong>.
And since that is my goal I want to take every opportunity to progress toward it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yesterday I had some beers with a few colleagues.
Also we had a quite useful and intense meeting about a lot of stuff.
Just a few thoughts that occurred to me after it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My boss said that he wants us, the mentors, to be more responsive.
<strong>Don’t just sit idle and talk about solutions</strong>, but rather <strong>jump into them and see what comes out of them</strong>.
He said something like <strong>don’t wait for everyone to give your ideas a green flag</strong>.
I think he’s right, but more importantly I think we should value a job like this and do our best to utilize it fully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other thing was that before the meeting and the drinks I felt different then usual.
Usually I’m getting worked up before these kind of situations.
I kept an open mindset.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, in the morning instead of sitting in front of my computer <strong>I deliberately choose to stand up and walk around</strong> the students to see what are they doing and I ended up helping a few of them.
While talking with them I experimented with &#8220;stuttering fluently&#8221;.
I think I did rather well.
Also, I tried to extend my awareness, tried to shift myself out of &#8220;heady&#8221; mode.
It’s quite hard to do it, but it’s quite refreshing to do something like that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well, I’m off to work, I’m heading with my boss to Budapest to meet up with the Budapest mentors and to see how’s the Budapest office/school is like.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_2016_december_5">2016 December 5</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> My Friday, Saturday and Sunday in a nutshell: Friday and Saturday was busy, Sunday I did nothing at all and I was miserable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last Friday I went to visit the Budapest office with my bosses, Máté and Józsi.
On the way to Budapest in the car we talked about work related things and problems.
Being with these guys in a car is a bit overwhelming.
They’re really down-to-the-earth guys, but still very overwhelming.
Always driven, very intelligent, well-spoken, funny, charismatic.
Typical leader material.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, I talked with Máté (when we were the only ones in the car) about &#8220;stuttering&#8221;.
He initiated the conversation with a remark &#8220;I see words with <em>P</em> are problematic&#8221; or something like that.
I went along with it for a while and tried to lay out the problem of &#8220;the scumbag brain&#8221; for him.
Talking about this didn’t make me more relaxed at the time.
Or at all, but now that I think about it &#8230;&#8203; it made me a bit more &#8220;aware&#8221;.
It was easier to keep my concentration while talking: being a bit slower, not holding my breath, or noticing that I’m holding it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We arrived at the Budapest school around just after 10am.
The students were presenting their weekly work, progress to IT-professionals from various Hungarian companies (they do this regularly, every week to &#8220;get the hang of it&#8221; and to keep them motivated).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The presentations themselves weren’t always that good, but the students and the other mentors’ approach, motivation was top notch, highly professional.
Overwhelming!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then we <strong>had lunch with</strong> these <strong>IT-professionals</strong>.
Which, again, was overwhelming.
These guys were representing multinational IT companies.
Some of them were University educators also.
Still, <strong>I tried to initiate</strong> a few <strong>conversations</strong>.
I was thinking &#8220;okay, <strong>I want to say X&#8221; so I said X</strong>.
Not always, but <strong>compared to my &#8220;old self&#8221; this was an improvement</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After lunch there were some other presentations by these IT people during which <strong>I wasn’t able to ask my questions</strong>.
I had some, but <strong>I held them in</strong>.
For two reasons, <strong>I wanted to give space for students to ask their own questions, and I got flustered about &#8220;not being able to ask what I wanted&#8221;</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>I told myself</strong> that &#8220;okay, <strong>I’ll wait and after that guy *I’ll ask my question&#8221; and time went by and the presentation was over</strong>.
That <strong>left a bad taste in my mouth</strong>, however we had the chance to talk with these guys after their presentations was over and <strong>I managed to ask my questions</strong> (almost all of them, we had to go, so there wasn’t time for everything).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the way home in the car Máté was asking me how did I feel myself at the office, what did I notice.
I told him that I felt the whole atmosphere was professional compared to the atmosphere in the Miskolc school.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also mentioned a game or method he learned from a &#8220;mentor coach&#8221; (motivational, life-style coaches hired by Codecool - two guys not from IT fields, more versed in philosophy and self-learning, etc.).
It’s called the &#8220;positive gossip&#8221; game.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A person from a group of 5-10 people sits apart from and with his back turned from the group while the group &#8220;gossips&#8221; about him, but only positive things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is supposed to help us to learn &#8220;how to give positive feedback&#8221;, because it’s  kind of hard to do that for some people (me included).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next stage of the game is &#8220;giving direct positive feedback&#8221; and the next after that is &#8220;giving direct negative feedback&#8221;.
The rules for giving negative feedback is that it should be phrased in a &#8220;matter of fact way&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like &#8220;last week I felt I wasn’t able to progress with my work, because John was lagging behind with his work&#8221;, instead of &#8220;John! You dumb nitwit, why didn’t you work faster, huh?! I had to do overtime because of you!&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, I think this is a good idea, <strong>I just don’t know</strong> yet <strong>how to &#8220;execute&#8221; this</strong> in action with our students &#8230;&#8203; but <strong>I want to do it</strong>.
<strong>I mention this, because I think, right now, I worry too much about this</strong>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Monday and Tuesday is behind me.
This is What happened stuttering-wise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Monday we, the mentors, started the day <strong>without a proper plan or schedule for day, and I was frustrated because of this</strong>.
It’s <strong>not my job to create one, but I still felt it was my responsibility</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, I <strong>tried to do my best</strong> considering that we had zero time to plan anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My fellow mentor came up with a plan, which basically was to assign 4-5 people to a mentor and &#8220;practice&#8221; with them for the upcoming (this Wednesday and Thursday BFA - big final assignment, actually big <em>f*cking</em> assignment).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I sit with three students and talked with them.
What happened?
I think I <strong>barely stopped talking for the day</strong>.
Stuttered a lot, <strong>haven’t avoided too much words</strong> (and when I did I tried to introduce those words into the conversation again).
I was semi-aware of the fact that I was talking too fast sometimes and I was able to &#8220;intervene&#8221; and slow my speech a bit a few times.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, I felt or did the following: I’ve noticed that I stuttered, I continued, but I <strong>got more and more &#8220;hyped&#8221;</strong> overtime.
And by the end of the day I was exhausted.
I felt my larynx and my entire body was tired.
I had a mild throat ache.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the day was over <strong>I examined what happened</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I didn’t take a short break and stood up the whole day (maybe once).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My water intake was lower than normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had a mindset where <strong>I noticed I stuttered, but I wanted to keep on talking</strong> so that I can talk better next time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Basically <strong>I wasn’t able to let go of &#8220;fluent speech&#8221;</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was Monday.
Today we did the same thing, I sit with five or six students and tried to tell them the same stuff that I talked about on Monday.
What did I do differently?
I was more prepared.
I set a timer for 50 minutes and told everybody that &#8220;okay guys, let’s do this for 50 minutes, after that I’ll need to take a breather and stand up to stretch a bit&#8221;.
So I did this.
What happened?
At the end of the day <strong>I was less tired and I was able to concentrate more easily on what I wanted to say</strong>.
I still stuttered and I have room for improvement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On both days I talked about my stuttering with the students (some of them are older than me, so it’s funny to call them as such).
They were interested about "`why did I choose to work at Codecool in Hungary instead of earning more money in London as an engineer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I told them <strong>I came to Codecool to improve my communication skills</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_2016_december_7">2016 December 7</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notes before session.
&#8220;Argument&#8221; with one of the students about &#8220;spoilering&#8221; the contents of the assignment they had.
&#8220;Don’t know what we’re doing&#8221; feeling before the exams started.
&#8220;Happy&#8221; feeling at the end of the day.
<strong>I felt I did well</strong>.
<strong>I’m proud of myself</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notes after session.
In-block (stretch, bounce, creaky) and post-block (space, grounding, repeat).
Wrote an email about this to Sarah.
I got mixed up about the terms.
<strong>Instead of self-advertising immediately when in post-block experiment with &#8220;grounding&#8221;</strong>, try to shift myself into a &#8220;safe place&#8221;.
Actually I should try to find a &#8220;safe place&#8221;.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_2016_december_14">2016 December 14</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wow, the last week went by in a flash.
I somehow managed to skip on writing anything here unfortunately.
It’s really cold around here (-7 degrees :O) and it’s quite the struggle to get up in the morning (when I usually write these with a fresh mind).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, this is what’s happened stuttering wise: I completely managed to forget about the idea of &#8220;grounding&#8221;.
The Thursday and Friday after our session on Wednesday was really busy, with the final exams for the students that the memory of it was phased out of my mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I did watch the video about &#8220;Body Language&#8221;.
I already heard about the term &#8220;fake it ‘til you make it&#8221; from Elliot, but this video gave a lot more context to it (testosterone and cortisol levels changing due to our mindset).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Friday the students received their exam results personally and I was the one who talked with almost all of them (10 or so people).
What <strong>I’ve noticed that I still rushing</strong>, getting fired up while talking.
I’m not sure why, maybe subconsciously I want to be the one doing the talking to show my conversational partner that I’m the man or similar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, <strong>I really want to experiment with letting this feeling go and focusing my mind on what I want to say</strong>.
Actually this is what &#8220;grounding&#8221; was about I guess :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a few times this week <strong>I consciously tried to stretch out the syllables of the words</strong> I blocked on while talking among relatives.
When I really got into <strong>the mindset which focuses on &#8220;stretching out the next syllable&#8221; it worked</strong>, however this is still hard to do because of the &#8220;hidden agenda&#8221; of the mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If I look back on the last week <strong>I was consciously doing what I wanted</strong>, <strong>not avoiding to say or do what I wanted and that’s awesome</strong>, because usually what happened after a situation where I avoided doing what was in my head was that I felt bad about it.
This didn’t happen this time around.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I remember that when I started the therapy I told myself (I might have told this Sarah as well at one point) that I <strong>&#8220;don’t want to hold back on saying what’s on my mind&#8221;</strong> (or doing it for that matter).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think I’ve <strong>improved a lot in regards</strong> to this.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_2016_december_16">2016 December 16</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today there was a party for the students at the school.
I felt bad for feeling in various ways: I <strong>felt out of place</strong>.
I felt <strong>wanting to leave</strong>.
I was <strong>envious of others</strong>: of their experience in life.
I felt that <strong>I won&#8217;t be able to achieve the same</strong> as them.
I was feeling &#8220;left behind&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now I’m thinking that it’s <strong>nice that I can be so honest about this with myself</strong>.
Being honest about this with others would be harder, but right now I think it would be interesting to pursue a conversation like this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also have a feeling that I &#8230;&#8203; I’m afraid I guess.
I’m <strong>amongst seriously amazing people</strong>.
I’d like to <strong>tap on their energy</strong> as funny as it sounds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But! I want to <strong>stay true to myself</strong> &#8230;&#8203; I don’t know what that means.
I don’t know what I want.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I want to get curious!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_2016_december_21">2016 December 21</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last week was mostly about partying and playing with my goddaughter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We had a staff lunch on Thursday evening, the school party on Friday evening and another school trip that was yesterday and today (Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Thursday I really <strong>liked the lunch we had: amazing food and drinks</strong>, only a few people present.
On Friday <strong>I enjoyed the food we prepared</strong> for the guests in the school.
Yesterday it <strong>felt good to horse around with the students and other mentors</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So generally it was okay.
The part I <strong>didn’t like</strong> is the fact that there are always certain people participating in these events <strong>who always want to &#8220;blackmail&#8221; others to drink or enjoy the party</strong> even more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In similar situations I <strong>usually feel bad for not being compatible with these people</strong> mindsets'.
Earlier in my life this was worse I think, others were able to &#8220;control&#8221; me.
It got better with time and I started to take control and do what I really want even if I felt &#8220;I made a bad choice and I suck&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nowadays, <em>today</em>, it’s almost the same, except <strong>I’m aware that what I want is what really matters and I shouldn’t feel bad about that</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I just remembered this about &#8220;feeling not being compatible&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, when <strong>someone asks me &#8220;do you want to come to the party?&#8221; my usual response is or was &#8220;no&#8221;</strong> and I felt bad about.
If others <strong>coerced me</strong> into coming I felt bad about that.
If I said &#8220;yes&#8221; I usually <strong>hated being there</strong> and felt bad about that=. If I’m already in a party and try leave earlier I <strong>feel bad for wanting to leave</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I feel like this a lot, not just about going to parties (however I don’t have any other examples at hand).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, I feel that I can do something about this knowledge: <strong>there are no best choice only the choice I come up with</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In term of &#8220;attending parties&#8221; I think the best for me would be to attend and then <strong>leave whenever I feel that being there is not beneficial for <em>me</em></strong> anymore.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During these events in the last week the &#8220;recurring feelings&#8221; were: feeling weird, being envious.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Weird?
I was the driver to the place where we held the party yesterday (about an hour drive from where the school is in a hilly, secluded village).
In the car there were times when nobody said anything.
I felt weird, because &#8230;&#8203; I’m not even sure why.
The same thing happened on the way home, however I had a headache so I wasn’t bothered by the silence too much.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Envious?
Yeah, I see awesome people everyday and I feel I’m not as good as them. That’s maybe true, and I know most of them may not as good as me in certain aspects of work or life, but still I feel like that.
It’s hard to <em>grok</em> it.
The worst is when I see that they don’t give a crap about anything and still &#8230;&#8203; yeah, seeing them being carefree is hard.
I’m envious of their carefreeness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Okay, but <strong>enough of this negativity!</strong>
Let’s get back to stuttering!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stuttering-wise this last week was kind of stagnating.
Since my last session with Sarah, when we talked about pre-block, the only thing that changed is that now <strong>I’m aware of the battle going on in my head</strong> right before I’m entering into &#8220;stutter struggle mode&#8221;.
I’m a long way from winning the battles!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_2016_december_25">2016 December 25</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yesterday was <strong>busy as hell</strong>.
The immediate family is together at our place:  my mother and grandmother, my brother and his wife and their daughter, my goddaughter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately my mother got sick the day before and my sister-in-law too.
She has a cyst in her leg and is pretty much unable to walk without elbow-crutches (it’s not as bad as it sounds, she’ll be okay, but her leg is inflamed right now).
Anyway, me and my brother were managing the household yesterday: shopping, baking, dishwashing, bathing my goddaughter, cleaning up, dressing up the Christmas tree, cleaning up and I don’t know what else.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What’s interesting in this is that I was being mad about my sister-in-law, because sometimes (actually it feels like all the time) she can act like a harpy towards my brother and sometimes towards me as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, I was <strong>having this feeling &#8220;being mad at someone&#8221;</strong>, but I also was <strong>able to zoom out on it</strong> and &#8220;chew&#8221; on it a bit, before drawing a conclusion on the thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also was conscious sometimes that &#8220;I <strong>wanted to lecture</strong>&#8221; her about something the way I usually do (to satisfy my need to say something and maybe to have the last word and &#8220;win&#8221; an argument), but instead of doing it I <strong>chose to just &#8220;observe&#8221;</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What’s <strong>even more interesting</strong> is the fact that I slept quite bad yesterday (I was dead tired, but I wasn’t able to sleep, because my sugar intake for the day was through the roof) and I <strong>had a dream about the first week of school next year</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last Friday I’ve prepared a rough schedule for the week, a daily routine for each day of the first week.
What I <strong>was dreaming</strong> about was that it’s already Tuesday and <strong>somehow I &#8220;wasted&#8221; the whole Monday without executing my previous plan</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tuesday <strong>my fear was that &#8220;now, at this point, I cannot follow up the plan I made and it’s all in vain and I’ve failed&#8221;</strong>, I felt paralyzed. After waking up I realized that my fear is based around my &#8220;all or nothing&#8221; behavior, the need to be perfect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think I <strong>was half-asleep</strong> when my consciousness kicked in somehow and <strong>managed to remember that &#8220;hey man, it’s still 2016, chill out&#8221;</strong>.
Or maybe it was only after I was fully awake.
It’s <strong>frightening how big of a scumbag the brain really is</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conclusion: yeah, I’m a bit <strong>concerned about the first week of 2017</strong>, but based on past experience <strong>it’ll be alright</strong> even if my brain wants to convince me otherwise.
Even if I’m going to waste that entire Monday somehow on Tuesday I’ll probably still be able to salvage my plan or a part of it and that’s okay.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Happy Christmas!</p>

<p>A new year.
I don’t have too much time today, but here are <strong>some good things already happened to me</strong>, because I’ve stuck to it!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>I had fears</strong>, pre-block moments weeks <strong>before the first week in the new year</strong>, because I knew I’ll be the one to facilitate the school, give tasks to the students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>My fear was that something will go wrong</strong> and it’ll be a disaster and <em>yadayada</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What happened?
Prior to the start of the week I had these fears.
I’ve <strong>remained objective</strong> about my goals, myself, my scumbag mind.
After the first Monday I’ve <strong>looked back on the events</strong> and here&#8217;s the summary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Things deviated from my initial plan, but it wasn’t a disaster.
Some of the students gave <strong>good feedback about me</strong> (&#8220;positive gossip&#8221;").
And I’ve managed to <strong>teach a new concept to them</strong> about programming about which they clearly didn’t know jack.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well.
Don’t have more time today.
One last thing.
One of the reasons of me coming to Codecool was that my <strong>former job sometimes was tediously boring</strong>.
It’s <strong>only Tuesday</strong> in the new year and &#8230;&#8203; <em>phew</em> man <strong>a lot has happened</strong> already.
Awesome!</p>

<p>I’ve remembered a thought that had appeared in the US TV show called <em>Westworld</em>. A character played by Anthony Hopkins says the following.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The human intellect was like peacock feathers. It&#8217;s an extravagant display intended to attract a mate. <strong>All of art</strong>, literature, a bit of Mozart, William Shakespeare, Michaelangelo, and the Empire State building&#8230;&#8203; just <strong>an elaborate mating ritual</strong>. Maybe it doesn&#8217;t matter that we have accomplished so much for the basest of reasons. The peacock can barely fly. It lives in the dirt, pecking insects out of the muck, consoling itself with its great beauty.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I thought this to be very captivating for some reason and I’ve remembered (the main idea) even after several days.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stuttering-wise I had some conscious moments since last week where I purposefully <strong>tried to <em>b-b-bounce</em> or <em>sss</em>lide on non-feared words</strong>.
Only in a few instances, I tried not to overdo it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What did I notice?
Well, right now I feel that I was already tense <strong>when I tried to experiment with this, as in I already blocked on a word</strong> or similar before trying to bounce a non-feared word, so the sensation was kind of the same.
However I was able to bounce when I wanted to.
And it’s getting easier to do it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have to mention that <strong>today I had to manage the class</strong>, some 21 people, alone (well, for the most part I was alone).
Did I stutter?
Sure thing.
Did it bother me as much as it would have done a year ago for instances?
Not nearly.
Did it bother me in a few cases?
Yeah it did, but <strong>I always said what I wanted</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also noticed that for few minutes (multiple times this day) I’ve experienced that <strong>I’ve been &#8220;in the zone&#8221;</strong>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I was totally absorbed in what I was doing while explaining things to the class.
When I noticed that &#8220;oh, I might have been in the zone&#8221; I immediately noticed the &#8220;<em>stuttery</em> feelings&#8221; I usually have (the scumbag mind) and I stuttered.
<strong>I might have stuttered even when I was focused</strong> on what I was doing, but <strong>it didn’t matter</strong> that time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>I was braver today</strong> than usual in a sense because <strong>I’ve approached everything I did today with a &#8220;I want to do this&#8221; mindset</strong>, or &#8220;I’m gonna try this thing even if somebody will say afterwards that it was a crappy thing to do&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It worked for the most part.
I’ve <strong>had an idea</strong> for an &#8220;energizing routine&#8221; to kick-off the day while walking to work and I <strong>executed the idea right away, ASAP, before I could &#8220;talk myself out of it&#8221;</strong>.
It worked brilliantly!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Okay.
Enough for now.
It was a good and productive day and it’s only Wednesday.
This place is crazy!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m writing this after my first therapy session in 2017 with Sarah.
This entry is written primarily to test if I can format my diary in a such a way that it makes easier to read and search.
We&#8217;ll see!
Oh, I&#8217;ll come up with a fancy way to flag important stuff in here too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A few hours after the session and after the whole day I feel the following are the key &#8220;takeaways&#8221; today.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, in order to become a <em>better version</em> of myself I&#8217;d like to do the following.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Continue develop good habits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try not to appeal to everyone rigidly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not to be hard on myself. Allow myself to be human.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today was the day also where we&#8217;ve played with the class the <em>3 good/3 bad qualities</em> game.
I&#8217;ve written the following about myself.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Good</dt>
<dd>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Perfectionism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to be curious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like to learn about almost anything (even useless things).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Bad</dt>
<dd>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Perfectionism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting the bar high</strong> for others and <strong>for myself</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I wrote a third bad attribute about myself, but I don&#8217;t remember what anymore.
Anyway, the main thing here is the one I&#8217;ve emphasized.
I set the bar too high sometimes, with which I&#8217;m pretty much setting myself up for failure.
However, I do like my perfectionist side, which kind of relates to this.
Bottom-line is that I want to aim for the balance, the perfect mix of these.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s all for now. I have to find the middle ground between pushing to the limit and sleeping too. Days are short!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And to stop with something positive: after all this entry wasn&#8217;t created only to justify trying out this new format.</p>

<h3 id="_2017_january_21">2017 January 21</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yesterday was the leaving party for one of my fellow mentor.
He leaves the Miskolc team and joins the Budapest team&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;so he remains our colleague only at a different location.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We had a few drinks and talked a lot about work and unrelated stuff also, a few interesting thing happened that I&#8217;d like to remember.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, first of all I had a talk with our new back office assistant, her name is Anett.
She wanted to ask me about my stutter, because she told me she considered herself to be a stutterer earlier in her life.
I tried to tell her about the whole situation, about the &#8220;stutterer mindset&#8221; in a nutshell.
Anett pointed out that she noticed that I have trouble with particular sounds.
She also said that when she stuttered back in the days she <em>scanned</em> for alternative ways for saying things.
I told her that <em>scanning</em> is one of those habits that I want to lose and that it&#8217;s ultimately unhelpful.
I liked talking about this, others joined the conversation too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the night what I feel is that I don&#8217;t want to become someone who forcefully pushes down a topic down on others' throats in a situation like this.
Yesterday this didn&#8217;t happen, the conversation about stuttering was organic.
What I mean by all of this is that even though I like to talk about this, I like being open about it, but I don&#8217;t want to become someone who can ultimately talk <em>only</em> about this.
So that&#8217;s that, I don&#8217;t want to push this onto others, but if they&#8217;re interested I&#8217;m game to talk about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other thing that happened is that after a few drinks (few in this instance means too much) I felt like I want to leave, go home.
Then the usual thing happened: the others who weren&#8217;t so ready to leave just yet tried to make me stay.
I usually feel bad about leaving in these situations.
This isn&#8217;t what bugs me though.
What bugs me is the fact that I try explain to the others why I want to leave and in the end somehow I end up feeling bad about.
I don&#8217;t have to reason for why I&#8217;m leaving and I want to learn this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While I was waking up, around 5am several things hurled inside my head.
It was quite overwhelming, but I had a bit of a hangover so I couldn&#8217;t control it.
I was thinking about being inferior to others at work.
About what Attila&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the mentor who&#8217;s going to Budapest&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;told me.
About Máté&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the boss basically&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;saying something &#8220;I believe in that guy&#8221; while pointing at me.
And of course about having a hangover, again, even though I promised myself that &#8220;I won&#8217;t drink anymore&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, one interesting thing was conjured in my mind during that time was this.
I remember that I felt that <strong>&#8220;I want to think before saying something&#8221;</strong>, or &#8220;doing&#8221; for that matter.
I&#8217;d like if I could talk with others, the students, other mentors, anyone in a way where I don&#8217;t &#8220;babble&#8221; around aimlessly.
I feel <strong>I could be &#8220;concise&#8221; in what I want to say if I could think before I&#8217;m saying something</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I remember however that after thinking about this I told myself that "hey, earlier I wanted to talk without thinking too much".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Quite opposing ideas, feelings.
I want to talk without thinking too much (without the hidden agenda), but I want to consider what I&#8217;m going to say before saying it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One other thing is that I feel I&#8217;m taking too much time writing these.
I&#8217;ll try and make these entries more straightforward if I can.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_2017_january_23">2017 January 23</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the last few days I&#8217;ve been out of touch with my stuttering.
I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s a good or a bad sign just now.
I&#8217;ve stuttered, no doubt about that, but it didn&#8217;t leave too much of an impact on me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why did that happen?
Either I&#8217;m too busy with other stuff to dwell on it or I just don&#8217;t care about it that much nowadays.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both of these reasons are okay if I think about it &#8230;&#8203; so I&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and I almost wrote <em>shouldn&#8217;t think about it then</em>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;may want to consciously invite this thought a bit, for further inspection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And upon further inspection, if I look back like two months ago, or even to my departure from London, what happened?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I wanted to make a summarized list of everything, but I&#8217;ve realized there are three things to point out.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>I&#8217;m <strong>not holding back as much</strong> as before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I <strong>want to change</strong> way <strong>too much</strong> sometimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I <strong>lost my daily focus</strong> on stuttering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>first</em> one is <strong>great</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>second</em> one is still isn&#8217;t half-bad, but I&#8217;d like to take the chance here to remind myself yet again that <strong>it&#8217;s okay</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>third</em> one seems bit alarming, but if I think about it it was to be expected. Eventually something like that is bound to happen. Again, that is okay I think, nowadays there were a <strong>lot of other stuff I&#8217;ve focused on</strong>. The old flame will come back eventually&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;if not, well then maybe that&#8217;s a good sign!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yesterday our company&#8217;s official &#8220;coach&#8221; Dávid asked if I&#8217;m available and willing to attend a training session in Budapest today.
It was on a short notice, but I said yes.
I was <em>curious</em> to see and experience what it&#8217;s like, because I&#8217;ve heard multiple different opinions about it&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;some mentors liked it, some not too much.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had a talk about this with Attila and he said that I should just try and keep an open mind and see how it goes, <strong>form my own opinions</strong>.
That was a good advice and I did just that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I <strong>didn&#8217;t have time to worry</strong> about the situation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;e.g. to leave my comfort zone. I <strong>wasn&#8217;t afflicted</strong> by this <strong>like I used to be</strong>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;practice makes perfect!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve talked about my stutter openly with people, but I didn&#8217;t forced it, it came naturally into conversation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the training started I&#8217;ve kind of set up a single goal in my mind: <strong>leave with a single &#8220;takeaway&#8221;</strong>.
So I&#8217;ve worked towards this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The theme of the training was <em>non-doing</em> and it was setup to help mentors give some idea about how to help or guide students, how to improve their soft-skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve taken some notes and underlined some thoughts I&#8217;ve liked.
Here are the top three.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t take responsibilities</strong> from others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give <strong>feedback on behavior</strong>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;instead of &#8220;labelling&#8221;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active listening&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<strong>relaxing</strong> while listening.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve been also shown a technique that Sarah has used on me when we started our sessions.
The &#8220;imagining your self on a scale&#8221; thing.
I&#8217;ve called <em>Black Magic Coaching Scale</em>.
It was interesting to be on &#8220;the other end&#8221; of the technique.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I feel that it was helpful in both personal and professional sense.
I&#8217;ll try to use what I&#8217;ve been shown or thought to the best of knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally I&#8217;d like to point out one key thing for myself.
<strong>It&#8217;s okay <em>not to</em> experiment with what I&#8217;ve learnt <em>right frickin' now!</em></strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_2017_january_27">2017 January 27</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yesterday my girlfriend asked if I could go with her to a &#8220;music venue&#8221;.
She&#8217;s into musicals, operas and the like so I was skeptical obviously.
She really wanted to go and hadn&#8217;t found anyone else who would be interested.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I said &#8220;okay&#8221;.
<strong>I wanted to keep open-mind</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve remained a bit skeptical though and made &#8220;funny remarks&#8221; about the situation (at least they were funny by my standards).
<strong>I don&#8217;t like the part of myself that makes these remarks</strong> all the time.
I do think that these are good and funny when placed at the right time and place.
So I&#8217;ll <strong>try and be more &#8220;cool&#8221; when something unnecessary</strong> or uncalled for <strong>wants to leave my system</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>About the performance: it was pretty good.
The theme was: famous songs from plays, operas, etc. spaced with funny intermezzos and anecdotes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don&#8217;t really like musicals and such, but I could appreciate the music.
It was full &#8220;classical setup&#8221;.
Violins, flutes, woodwinds, brass instruments, etc., even a French conductor with all the wacky hand movements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Five performers performed during the night, three girls and two guys.
Opera, light opera, musical singers, actors and whatnot.
All of them were great really.
I prefer a male singing voice so I&#8217;d appreciated the guys singing more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>What captured my attention</strong> though wasn&#8217;t the fact they could sing, but <strong>their &#8220;presence&#8221;</strong>.
The presence of the guys especially.
The way they walked, the manner they carried themselves, the way they sat, their motions, everything oozed <strong>confidence</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best thing happened in the end.
I was kind of feeling the whole performance was already too long and wanted to go.
Then, the opera guy (Zsolt Homonnay) came busting onto the stage to the music of <em>U Can&#8217;t Touch This</em> by MC Hammer.
I&#8217;m serious that I haven&#8217;t laughed like yesterday in a <em>looong</em> time.
Such a contrast.
And the best is that this performance was awesome too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conclusion: <strong>keeping an open-mind is awesome</strong>!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_2017_january_31">2017 January 31</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today was the second mentor training day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main takeaways for me today were that</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I usually take on others' responsibilities</strong>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>during meetings I want focus on <strong>problems <em>and</em> solutions</strong>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and <strong>specific feedback on behavior is best</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Out of all these stuttering- and mindset-wise the first is the most interesting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why?
I do that even though <strong>I&#8217;m aware of it</strong>.
Why?
Somehow I, or <strong>my mind, always manage to persuade me</strong> &#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And right now a revelation came to me, <strong>a feeling which I won&#8217;t ignore</strong> like so many others.
<em>Whys</em> aren&#8217;t important just now.
<strong>What&#8217;s important right is that I&#8217;m aware of this and that&#8217;s enough</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Something other to note.
I still notice that <strong>I tense up inadvertently</strong> in everyday situations.
Like during typing this, or when I was sitting of the back of the car of my colleague back to the station at Budapest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I like to feel relaxed.
We&#8217;ve talked about this during the training as well as an important factor in being a good &#8220;active listener&#8221;.
So, I&#8217;ll <strong>continue nurturing the good of habit of being relaxed</strong> whenever it make sense.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_2017_february_1">2017 February 1</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just a thought that came to me while I was in the middle of waking up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yesterday during the mentor training <strong>I was praised for having shown symptoms of &#8220;growth mindset&#8221;</strong>.
We were asked to solve a simple logical challenge, by ourselves in a few minutes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the game our coach, Dávid, pointed out that he wasn&#8217;t interested in the outcome of the game, but our behavior.
He mentioned that a few of us started the challenge with a &#8220;fixed mindset&#8221;, saying &#8220;I&#8217;m not good at games like this&#8221;, or similar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was interesting to hear his <strong>opinion about me</strong>.
I wasn&#8217;t aware that <strong>I said</strong> something like &#8220;I have <strong>no <em>frickin'</em> clue how to solve this, but <em>I&#8217;ll try to do something anyway</em></strong>&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was another point he mentioned, but I don&#8217;t remember that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>I remember saying that I didn&#8217;t get frustrated by not being the first</strong> one to figure out the solution.
Instead <strong>what bugged me that I saw someone else&#8217;s solution</strong> which kind of spoiled my fun.
Because I like to get to a solution myself.
That&#8217;s how I learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the game we watched a video on YouTube about growth mindset.
Seeing it and hearing <strong>the positive feedback</strong> I mentioned before <strong>reinforces me that I&#8217;m a path that&#8217;s beneficial for me</strong>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s the third day and (for now) the end of the Mentor Training.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During my journey from the training location to the railway station I&#8217;ve <strong>looked back</strong> to the last week.
It <strong>felt difficult to remember <em>everything</em></strong> since my last therapy session with Sarah.
A few things came to mind in regards to that.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Without trying to dug hard <strong>no <em>suuu</em>per negative thoughts came</strong> to mind,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>except one: the fact that "no <em>suuu</em>per negative thoughts came to mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But this I&#8217;m <strong>attributing to me being the way I am</strong> right now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good description to the <em>way I am right now</em>  would be what <strong>Sarah told me</strong> last time about working with me.
I don&#8217;t remember the exact words, but I do <strong>remember the gestures she used and the fluffy sensation</strong> I was feeling when hearing the words. So I feel like being <em>that way</em> still.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I think about this I feel <strong>what I do is enough</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A few things are on the top of my head. In no particular order.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remembering that <strong>Sarah told me that she thinks I put in a lot of effort into our sessions</strong> and the feeling I felt hearing that: it felt good, but I remember that <strong>my mind was trying to <em>play</em> me with stuff like &#8220;oh of course she says that&#8221;</strong> and that I had to &#8220;battle it out&#8221; with saying stuff to myself &#8220;it looks like hers is genuine response man&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other thing is the situational game we&#8217;ve played during the training.
Someone needed to <strong>improvise in front of the others</strong> (five other people) in a random topic.
<strong>I volunteered.</strong>
The topic was &#8220;my cool imaginary friend&#8221;.
The others' task were to assess how I use <strong><em>words</em></strong> how I use my voice (<strong><em>music</em></strong>) and how I use space, my hands (<strong><em>dance</em></strong>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I stood in front of everyone and talked about this non-existent guy picking up girls, ordering drinks at the bar in a &#8220;cool way&#8221; and trying to dangerously pass a car while I was driving by hijacking the steering wheel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had two minutes.
After it I felt a bit hot.
I stuttered once or maybe twice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After it the others gave me a feedback about how it was.
I was still feeling a bit hot, because I <strong>felt that it wasn&#8217;t <em>that</em> good</strong>.
But, the <strong>others said surprisingly good stuff</strong> about how my voice were loud and soft sometimes (going through the spectrum) or that I tried to keep eye-contact with everyone for a little while.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>feedback wasn&#8217;t <em>completely</em> positive</strong>, I would say all were useful.
Someone pointed out that I tried to make my imaginary friend too realistic, they would&#8217;ve expected a world-traveler type of action hero kind of guy.
Yeah, <strong>I didn&#8217;t like that, but I was like &#8220;hey, I was first, others after me will have it easier&#8221;</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What <strong>I want to point out</strong> is that this time <strong>I had a much easier time processing</strong> the feedback and the whole day.
It was easier to see the good in everything.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Something else to note is that learning about these &#8220;non-doing&#8221; principles helps too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To sum up I&#8217;d say that with <strong>more and more practice</strong> I&#8217;m becoming <strong>more and more aware</strong> and that&#8217;s good.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Oh, two things came to just now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I <strong>was aware of <em>softening</em></strong> during this week.
<strong>Still thinking about it as a way to be fluent</strong>, a way to not show that I stutter I feel.
For example when saying <em>köszönöm</em> (&#8220;thank you&#8221; in English) today in multiple places (café, restaurant) I got stuck on the word.
I <strong>wanted to soften it, but thinking about that didn&#8217;t bring up memories about relaxing, focusing on the first syllable</strong>, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But, there were a <strong>few cases when this happened</strong> and it worked.
<strong>I&#8217;m getting there!</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other thing &#8230;&#8203; it kind of left me, but of yeah, it&#8217;s back.
So the other cool thing is that <strong>I&#8217;ve noticed today that I&#8217;ve recognized flaws in others</strong> that I&#8217;ve already identified in myself.
Sarah will love this, but <strong>they were saying stuff like &#8220;I should have done that&#8221; or that &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think that&#8221;</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don&#8217;t remember the exact thing they said.
Unfortunately in my mind I was focusing on &#8220;trying to flag this up to them and to help&#8221;.
<strong>I felt &#8220;<em>haha</em>, I&#8217;m smarter than you and you don&#8217;t even know it&#8221;</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then I <strong>remembered this &#8220;non-doing&#8221; thing</strong> and that I&#8217;ve decided that <strong>I want to develop the habit of &#8220;not trying to help others forcefully&#8221;</strong>.
For multiple reasons.
If it&#8217;s my idea or forced it won&#8217;t stick.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If I would take the time to re-read what <strong>I&#8217;ve written here in the last few weeks</strong> I would find that I wrote something like <strong>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to become someone who&#8217;s forcing his stuttering baggage onto others&#8221;</strong> or something like that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And now I think I can refine this with something I&#8217;ve learnt during the training: <strong><em>solution focus</em> is more beneficial than <em>problem focus</em></strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, turning around what I&#8217;ve written earlier &#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Oh, I <strong>was thinking &#8220;this will be something new&#8221;</strong>, but I&#8217;ve realized I&#8217;ve <strong>already came to this conclusion</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Which is that <strong>I want to be someone who <em>thinks</em> before he <em>talks</em></strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And now I&#8217;m getting teary-eyed a bit, because this is what exactly happened.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_2017_february_12">2017 February 12</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yesterday evening and today morning I was thinking about my session with Sarah.
I told her I want to set aside an hour for myself, <em>just</em> for myself, where I can be like I&#8217;m during our sessions.
Then I&#8217;ve read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/5thc8s/tool_how_to_actually_make_meditation_a_habit_in/">this post on Reddit</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve <strong>talked about grounding, relaxing</strong> and all that stuff with Sarah, but somehow <strong>it didn&#8217;t take true roots in me</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>After reading the post I felt that I&#8217;m ready for this</strong>.
Not just because someone told me, but I truly saw the benefit of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, setting aside a few minutes, or an hour every week <em>for myself</em> seems silly now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meditating daily sounds a better idea now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One last thing to note is, that <strong>after reading the post and thinking about meditation</strong> I quickly tried to meditate for a few minutes.
It was interesting that afterwards <strong>I got a bit gloomy</strong>, Eszti (my girlfriend) and my mother made a remark about it too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I wasn&#8217;t gloomy at all as far as I know.
<strong>I was more like more aware of my surroundings, the voices, the gestures.</strong>
It was interesting, but I don&#8217;t want to seem gloomy when I&#8217;m too aware.
Smile!</p>

<h3 id="_2017_february_14">2017 February 14</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last two days were difficult.
I felt overwhelmed multiple times, mostly because I wasn&#8217;t able to let go of things.
I wanted to do <em>everything</em> all at once impeccably.
Nobody can do that, so <em>no wonder</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, I had a talk with one of the students today.
I wanted to &#8220;help him&#8221;.
Forcibly, I admit, he never asked directly for help.
But, this matter is for another day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The point is that while talking with him I&#8217;ve remembered a quote I&#8217;ve read in the &#8220;stuttering self-help book&#8221; a year before my sessions with Sarah.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve managed to find out with some digging that it was a book by Cavett Robert from  his book <em>Human Engineering and Motivation</em>.
As a student he asked his professor to give a definition of &#8220;character&#8221;.
His professor&#8217;s reply went as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Young fellow I&#8217;m not sure, but I am going to give you a definition that I want you to keep until you can find a better one.<br>
<strong>Character is the ability to carry out a good resolution long after the mood in which it was made has left you.</strong><br>
Now I didn&#8217;t say just the ability to carry out a good resolution. We all have our moments of supreme dedication&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;whether it be fidelity to a person or loyalty to an ideal.
But how few of us carry out that resolution when the mood has left us and the tides of temptation come sweeping in.<br>
Tomorrow morning, you are going to have a test on the material we have covered over the past few days.<br>
Tonight you will perhaps decide that you are going to get up at six o&#8217;clock in the morning and study for this test. And actually you are going to get up in the morning&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that is, tonight you are, because you are in the mood.<br>
But tomorrow morning when you stick your foot out and it touches the cold floor you don&#8217;t have that mood any longer. <strong>I say character is that which you have within yourself to substitute for the mood which has left you. Character is that which causes you to exercise the self-discipline to get up anyway.</strong></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During my talk with the student I decided, because I was <em>motivated</em>, that I&#8217;ll search for this quote and I&#8217;ve stuck to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But now, well after 11pm, I&#8217;m feeling that <strong>I wasn&#8217;t able to set my priorities straight</strong> today.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I feel <strong>I&#8217;m someone who has the character to <em>remember</em> the original mood</strong> that has left him.
Now I <strong>want to work on being someone who can also substitute it</strong> better than I usually do.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I wanted to write something here since last week, but somehow it didn&#8217;t work out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of this I was <strong><em>beating myself up</em> subconsciously</strong> (a little).
Something like &#8220;you&#8217;re not putting enough effort into this&#8221; went through in my head a few times.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fortunately <strong>the part of my that is more aware</strong> than a few months before is at work too.
It&#8217;s <strong>saying things like &#8220;yeah, well, it&#8217;s okay</strong>, you were busy with a lot other things as well&#8221;.
And that helps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s recap what has happened since last week.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&#8217;ve postponed my session with Sarah because I was at Budapest on that Wednesday.
<strong>Interviewing Codecooler&#8217;s</strong> at our office in the capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Had a <strong>wonderful evening</strong> with my girlfriend.
An &#8220;after-Valentine&#8217;s Day dinner&#8221;, because I couldn&#8217;t care less about Valentine&#8217;s Day, but I do enjoy a lovely dinner!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Started <strong>learning in a <em>mindful</em> way about electronics</strong> (voltage, current, all that stuff).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Started <strong>meditating</strong> a few minutes a day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Office yoga</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The interviews were interesting.
<strong>I was praised</strong> by one of my fellow mentor.
He taught the way I&#8217;ve handled the interview was really good.
Before he said this <strong>I thought it wasn&#8217;t that good, but I wasn&#8217;t affected by these thoughts</strong> as much as my &#8220;older version&#8221; was.
I&#8217;ve getting more and more battle hardened.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The dinner was awesome.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I want <strong>learn about micro-controllers, but I don&#8217;t have the basics</strong>.
Basics like how voltage, current and resistance relate &#8230;&#8203; I&#8217;ve learned about this, but I&#8217;ve never used it.
Anyway, I&#8217;ve <strong>found a book online</strong>, a complete course around electronics and I&#8217;ve decided to start reading it.
A few minutes a day.
Being <strong><em>mindful</em> while I&#8217;m reading</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meditating.
I think I&#8217;ve wrote about this, but I&#8217;ve read a Reddit post about <em>mindfulness</em> and <em>meditation</em>.
So after that I&#8217;ve decided that I want to experiment with this.
Since I&#8217;ve written about it <strong>I&#8217;m meditating daily</strong>.
Not in a rigid &#8220;I have to meditate so leave me alone&#8221; way.
More in a "okay, <strong>I have some time, let&#8217;s meditate 3 minutes and see how it goes</strong>".
This way it works better, feels more relaxed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I should note here that <strong>meditation</strong>, where you focus on your breathing, letting your usual thoughts go <strong>is <em>haaard</em></strong>, but refereshing at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One another thing I&#8217;ve started doing is &#8220;office yoga&#8221;.
By this I mean I&#8217;m just doing some <strong>exercises during my workday</strong> whenever I have time.
And also, I&#8217;m breaking up my day in a &#8220;Pomodoro way&#8221; (I&#8217;m a poet and I didn&#8217;t even know it!).
I&#8217;m not sticking to it strictly, because I don&#8217;t like doing it that way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I gave 25 minutes for myself to write something here by the way.
That&#8217;s up, but I think what I&#8217;ve written here is enough for my purposes: <em>to keep being aware</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_2017_february_27">2017 February 27</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about what to write here yesterday and today as well.
I&#8217;ve came to the conclusion that right now <strong>what I write here and how much</strong> I&#8217;m writing <strong>is secondary to other things</strong> like</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>learning about electronic circuits,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or meditating and relaxing,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or playing the guitar,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or reading,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>running,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#8220;Sarah time&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What I&#8217;m doing is I&#8217;m trying to set aside a small amount of time for <em>everything</em> I&#8217;m interested in and I try to regularly do them or fiddle with them.
<strong>Regularly</strong> and <strong>small amount</strong> of time are the keywords.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My <strong>stuttering</strong> (or the lack of it) <strong>is still important</strong>, but I got to know it to such a degree that I can handle it.
At least far easier than I was able to earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m <strong>still frustrated sometimes</strong> when I feel that my stutter is holding me back, but <strong>even in those moments I&#8217;m able to overcome my fears and anxieties</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I think about stuttering <strong>I relate to it <em>completely</em> differently</strong> now.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_2017_march_9">2017 March 9</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yesterday I&#8217;ve attended a play with Eszter.
She asked me to accompany her a few days before.
At first I hesitated, <strong>my usual &#8220;negative&#8221; self surfaced</strong>.
I told Eszter that &#8220;I&#8217;m not in a state in which I can make a decision, <strong>ask me tomorrow</strong>&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So she asked me and I said &#8220;of course, let&#8217;s go&#8221;.
I thought about it and I envisioned myself enjoying it.
I&#8217;ve <strong>experimented with the idea that it could be really good</strong> or it could be interesting in a way I wouldn&#8217;t even think about at first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The play itself was a rendition of a well-known Hungarian play <em>The Tragedy of Man</em>.
Very famous.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, what happened was that I kind of enjoyed it.
It was too long and the ending was rushed and dense, but otherwise the night was enjoyable, I was able to enjoy it on different axes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One thing worth mentioning here is that I <strong>saw my high-school Hungarian literature teacher</strong>.
She was (I assume) attending with her class&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I saw several high-school student in the audience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve played with the idea that I go up to her and initiate a conversation, but <strong>I was afraid</strong>.
Afraid, because maybe <strong>she wouldn&#8217;t recognize me</strong> and then <strong>I would need to introduce myself</strong> and then that would be kind of hard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eventually I didn&#8217;t go up to her, I convinced myself that &#8220;this isn&#8217;t the right time&#8221;.
I was thinking about why &#8220;would I speak to her?&#8221; and I ended up with the answer &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to speak with her really&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, when I&#8217;m in situations like this, it kind of feels I&#8217;m not sure if I really want to talk to somebody or that I just want to talk to them to prove to myself that I can talk with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And now, reflecting on what happened I&#8217;m not sure still if I wanted to talk to her or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, in order that I could decide this with a hundred percent accuracy, next time something like this happens I&#8217;ll try to <strong>overcome fear with <em>curiosity</em></strong>.</p>
