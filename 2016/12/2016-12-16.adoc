=== 2016 December 16

Today there was a party for the students at the school.
I felt bad for feeling in various ways: I *felt out of place*.
I felt *wanting to leave*.
I was *envious of others*: of their experience in life.
I felt that *I won't be able to achieve the same* as them.
I was feeling "`left behind`".

Now I’m thinking that it’s *nice that I can be so honest about this with myself*.
Being honest about this with others would be harder, but right now I think it would be interesting to pursue a conversation like this.

I also have a feeling that I ... I’m afraid I guess.
I’m *amongst seriously amazing people*.
I’d like to *tap on their energy* as funny as it sounds.

But! I want to *stay true to myself* ... I don’t know what that means.
I don’t know what I want.

I want to get curious!
