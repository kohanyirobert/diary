Notes before session.
"`Argument`" with one of the students about "`spoilering`" the contents of the assignment they had.
"`Don’t know what we’re doing`" feeling before the exams started.
"`Happy`" feeling at the end of the day.
*I felt I did well*.
*I’m proud of myself*.

Notes after session.
In-block (stretch, bounce, creaky) and post-block (space, grounding, repeat).
Wrote an email about this to Sarah.
I got mixed up about the terms.
*Instead of self-advertising immediately when in post-block experiment with "`grounding`"*, try to shift myself into a "`safe place`".
Actually I should try to find a "`safe place`".
